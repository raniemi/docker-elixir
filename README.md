docker-elixir
===============

This repository is used for creating and publishing versioned [Docker images of Elixir](https://hub.docker.com/r/raniemi/elixir/).  Both [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) and [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) are installed using the packaging made available by [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html).

The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image builds are executed by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/raniemi/docker-elixir) on [versioned Github branches](https://github.com/raniemi/docker-elixir/branches).

Copies of the [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html) packaging are managed on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/raniemi/erlang-solutions-unofficial-mirror) for performance and availability reasons.

Currently only the latest version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) is supported.
